# DOF

DOF is a type(inter)face initiated on the occasion of the exhibition and research project _[The Weathers They Live In](http://twtli.nicolaarthen.com)_. Written in the typographic description language METAFONT, DOF can be understood as a set of genes to generate different font families by the regulation of parameters. 

At present the major parameters are _unit-width_, _pen-width_ and _-height_, _slant_, _overdraw_, _superness_, _cutoff / expand_ and . Throughout the development the three families [DOF-1](/outline/DOF-1/), [DOF-2](/outline/DOF-2/) and [DOF-3](/outline/DOF-3/) have been released and converted to outline fonts (TrueType). DOF supports the ASCII character set with some additional characters. Further parameters and glyphs will be developed in the future, requests are welcome.

DOF is licensed under _SIL Open Font License_ and free to use. 

# Docs

The comprehensive typographic description language METAFONT was created by Donald E. Knuth, nothing of DOF would be possible without his programmatic dedication to typography and his longtime work on the typeface _Computer Modern_. These docs will give an overview of DOF's structure and font rendering. For a deeper understanding of METAFONT read _The Concept of a Meta-Font_ and the _METAFONTbook_ by Donald E. Knuth.
