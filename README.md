# DOF

_DOF_ is a typeface to _interface_ the program of _[The Weathers They Live In](http://twtli.nicolaarthen.com)_ and its contributions. _DOF_ is created by Paul Bernhard and written in the typographic language METAFONT by Donald E. Knuth. Different cuts are being rendered during the course of _TWTLI_. At present DOF-versions 1, 2, 3 are released and the font files can be found in their respective folders:

- DOF-1 [source files](/DOF-1/source) and [outline files](/DOF-1/outline)
- DOF-2 [source files](/DOF-2/source) and [outline files](/DOF-2/outline)
- DOF-3 [source files](/DOF-3/source) and [outline files](/DOF-3/outline)

All versions of _DOF_ are free to use.

An _interface_ is a cut surface that enables the communication between two parties. Thereby it has two sides, one side for each party to connect up. These two sides can be roughly divided into backend and frontend. The backend – the hidden to the party – is the sending part to ask the performance of a specified task and serves an output to the frontend. The frontend – the visible to the party – is the receiving part of the process to „display“ the backend’s output. The communication process can be initiated from both sides and it’s the party’s perspective that defines the roles of backend and frontend.

The basic idea of an _interface_ is that of a translator who is given a dictionary to mediate between the two parties. Therefor _interfaces_ require a sensitivity to introduce itself to the party seamlessly in a self-evident manner – often superimposed by a high sensuality – and in an ideal setup this translating role becomes actually insensible to the two parties who are given the feeling to understand each other natively. 

Possible _interfaces_ could be:
- a button to allow the communication between a pusher and an electric circuit
- a website to allow the communication between user and server
- a cookie to allow the communication between a dog and a human
- street signs to allow the communication between cars at an intersection
- a layer of fabric to intermediate between two extreme temperatures

A main application of _interfaces_ is that of providing a communication between a human and a machine. Assuming this machine has no sensitivity to pressure and this human’s input is a touch, an _interface_ could wrap itself around the machine’s „body“ in form of a tactile skin. In this case the skin’s hair would form the frontend which understands sympathetically moving gestures. The hair posts the input through a dermal layer to the inside which forms the backend. The backend understands the input and can render it into a comprehensible task for the machine to perform. In return, this performance outputs back through the dermal layer for the frontend to „display.“

A simple example would be a contracted ball-shaped machine which should expand on touch. Wrapped in an interfacing skin, the touched skin tells the machine to expand. In doing so, the machine stretches the wrapping skin and it is this skin that gives back a sensation of expansion. For the hand the presence of the machine does not matter and vice versa. For each it is finally the presence of the _interface_ that counts.
