# DOF

_DOF_ is a typeface to interface the exhibition [_The Weathers They Live In](http://twtli.nicolaarthen.com)_ and its contributions. _DOF_ is written in the typographic language METAFONT by Donald E. Knuth and different cuts will be rendered during the course of _TWTLI_. 

At present _DOF-1_ is released. The METAFONT source files can be found in [/source/](/dof-1/source/) and the font files (.ttf, .woff, .woff2) can be found in [/outline/export/](/DOF-1/outline/Export). All versions of _DOF_ are freely available and usable.
