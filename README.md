# DOF

_DOF_ is a typeface to interface the program of _[The Weathers They Live In](http://twtli.nicolaarthen.com)_ and its contributions. _DOF_ is created by Paul Bernhard and written in the typographic language METAFONT by Donald E. Knuth. Different cuts will be rendered during the course of _TWTLI_. 

At present _DOF-1_ and _DOF-2_ are released. The METAFONT source files and the outline files (.ttf, .woff, .woff2) can be found in their respective directories:

DOF-1 source files: [/dof-1/source](/DOF-1/source)

DOF-2 source files: [/dof-2/source](/DOF-1/source)
DOF-2 font files[/dof-2/outline/export](/DOF-1/outline/Export)

All versions of _DOF_ are free to use.
